Putting pieces together: Building a program.
Basically, have an input that always runs until someone writes /end.
Print out everything the user wrote. 
If the user wrote a question, add a ? at the end.
I could make it more complex (like check if the ending already has a ? or .)
But this is what I came up very quickly before looking at solutions:
'''
storage=[]
while True:
    text=input("Say something")
    if text=='\end' or text=='/end':
        break
    else:
        words=text.split()
        first=words[0].capitalize()
        if first in ['What', 'How', 'Why', 'Who', 'Where']:    
            storage.append(text+'?')
        else:
            storage.append(text+'.')
print(storage) 


'''
Here is the best solution that is slightly more readable:
'''
def sentence_maker(phrase):
    ogatives=("how", "what", "why")
    capitalized=phrase.capitalize()
    if phrase.startswith(ogatives):
        return "{}?".format(capitalized)
    else:
        return "{}".format(capitalized)
    
print(sentence_maker("how are you"))

results=[]
while True:
    user_input=input("Say something: ")
    if user_input=='\end':
        break
    else:
        results.append(sentence_maker(user_input))
#print(results)
final=" ".join(results)
print(final)
